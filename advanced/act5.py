ACTIVITY 5: Which Library? (Libraries)

Bobert is writing a new spam bot in Python. He doesn't want to write tons of code, so he is looking for a library to help him with email. He also wants one in the Python Standard Library instead of one made by some rando in PyPI. Can you find what he is looking for?
