ACTIVITY 6: I Love Conditionals (Conditionals)

Bobert is writing a complicated program to determine what to wear based on the temperature. He has some VERY specific requirements. If the weather is exactly 75 degrees, he wants to wear a t-shirt. Else, if the weather is between 0 and 32 degrees, inclusive, he wants to wear a gigantic coat. Else, if the weather is less than 40 or greater than 90, he doesn't want to go outside. Else, if the weather is greater than 75, he will wear a t-shirt and shorts. Else, if the weather is less or equal to than 50, he will wear a jacket. Otherwise, he will wear a long-sleeved shirt.

Help Bobert write a program to determine what he should wear!
