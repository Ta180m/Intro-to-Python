ACTIVITY 13: Fix the Code! (Printing, variables)

One of your group members wrote the code below, but it doesn't work for some reason. Can you find out why?

Can you make the code mash together all the variables and print one long string? (answer should be "-619717-25")
Can you make the code actually add the variables together and print the result? (answer should be 28)
'''

var1 = -61
var2 = "97"
var3 = 17
var4 = "-25"

print(var1 + var2 + var3 + var4)
