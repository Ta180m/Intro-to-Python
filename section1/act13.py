ACTIVITY 13: Print Me (Printing, variables)

Billiam created two variables, my_name and my_age. Sure, you can print my_name and my_age using two separate print statements.

But you know what's cooler? Printing my_name and my_age using only one print statement. Make sure you convert my_age to a string using str( ), since it is an integer.

my_name = "Billiam"
my_age = 13
