PRINTING OUTPUT

Let's get started with learning Python!

# This is a comment
# It doesn't do anything

# A multiple-line comment

Your first podcast will be awful
Your first video will be awful
Your first article will be awful
Your first art will be awful
Your first photo will be awful
Your first game will be awful
But your first code will be perfect.
Zero bugs and very clean code.
It will be "Hello, world!"
'''


# Your first program
# It prints Hello, world! in the console
# The console is the black box on the right
# Press "Run" at the top to see it in action!
print("Hello, world!")

# If you type python in the console, it will start up an interactive Python session
# You know you are in a PYTHON console when it shows the >>>
# Instead of the orange thing
# You can then type in code and Python will run it as you go

# Print some more text
# To print text, it MUST BE IN QUOTES
print("Python is fun!")
print("I love Python!")
print("My name is Billiam")

Let's do Activity 1 now!
Click on act1.py in the left sidebar to open Activity 1.
'''


# note that the 4 doesn't have quotes
# it is an integer AKA a whole number
print(4)

# When we print a math expression, Python evaluates it
# Note that this does not print text because there are no quotes!
# Prints 4
print(2 + 2)

# Prints the LITERAL TEXT 2 + 2
print("2 + 2")

# Each print puts the result on a new line
print("2 + 2 = ")
print(2 + 2)

# Python will evaluate complicated math expressions
print(1729 - 42 - 13)
print(9 + 10 * (7 * 5 - 3))

# Prints a blank line
print()

# When you type something in the console, Python will automatically print it out
# For example, if we type in the console:
2 + 2
# Prints 4 automatically, but ONLY in the console
# If you click RUN, Python will not print stuff out unless you use print( )

Now let's look at Activities 2 and 3!
